                        This blog post is a special one for me. It represents something I've always wanted to do and dreamed of. Doing an Erasmus exchange was a goal I set for myself when I started my studies at Howest. I wanted to experience a different culture, meet new people, and challenge myself academically. In this post, I'll share my experiences and insights from my Erasmus exchange.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="how">How?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The process of applying for an Erasmus exchange can be daunting, but it was made easier with the support of my university. I had to fill out several forms, provide proof of my academic performance, and write a motivation letter explaining why I wanted to go on an exchange.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="what">What?</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my Erasmus, I studied Computer Science while getting the chance to explore topics and work on projects that were a bit different from what I was used to at home. It pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible. I learned to adapt to new teaching styles and collaborate with students from all over Europe, which gave me a broader perspective on both tech and teamwork.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="where">Where?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I spent my semester in Barcelos, Portugal, at the Instituto Politécnico do Cávado e do Ave (IPCA). It’s a small town with a relaxed atmosphere, but it quickly felt like home. From spontaneous trips to nearby cities like Porto and Braga, to afternoons at the beach in Esposende, there was always something to do. And of course, the food and weather were amazing. Pastéis de nata became my weakness.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        My Erasmus exchange was an incredible experience that allowed me to immerse myself in a new culture, meet amazing people, and grow both personally and academically. I highly recommend anyone considering an Erasmus exchange to take the leap and go for it. The memories and skills you gain will last a lifetime.
