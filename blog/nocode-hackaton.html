                    <p>
                        Today I had the exciting opportunity to participate in the NoCode Hackaton at Howest. This event was organized and hosted by Howest. The goal of the event was to create an AI chatbot using NoCode tools. Never having been to a hackaton before, I was very excited to see what it would be like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now for people who are maybe a bit confused by the term hackaton, and maybe think that it has something to do with hacking, let's look at what Wikipedia says:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><em>"A hackathon is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours" ~ Wikipedia</em></p> 
                     </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Certain companies came and each gave their own use case of how they would be able to use an AI chatbot. The company that I worked with was <a href="https://www.dieto.be/" class="underline-link">Dieto</a>. Dieto is a Belgian company specialised in project design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was presented with a dataset tha consisted the most out of pricelist of products. Based on this info I had to create a tool using tools from the platform <a href="https://www.nocode-x.com/" class="underline-link">NoCode-X</a> who were also present on-site.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 id="first-time-nocode">First time with NoCode</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now personally I had <code>never</code> used NoCode before. I was very curious to see how I could use this platform to create a tool that could help Dieto. I was very surprised to see how easy it was to create a tool using NoCode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just like we would do coding normally we would split the application into 3 parts: data, ui and logic where the data came from the dataset, the ui was made with templates and the logic was implemented using a logic hierarchy with each step having a task.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="during-the-day">During the day</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the day we had the possibility to socialize with other students, since this was a collaboration between the IT students and the business students. This was a great opportunity to meet new people and to learn from each other.
                        I also got to give props to Howest for the very nice fries they provided us with during the break. üçü
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion - The end result</h2>
                    <p>
                        After a day of hard work, I delivered a bot that had all the features that Dieto wanted. It was easy to interact with making it suitable for everyone. I was very happy with the end result and I learned a lot about NoCode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon presenting this idea I was also nominated to win a prize (cinema ticket) for the best idea. I was very happy with this and it was a great experience to have.
